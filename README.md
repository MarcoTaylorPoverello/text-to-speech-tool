# text-to-speech-tool
A tool that takes the text you input and reads it back to you in a voice of your choosing

# How it was built

- A combination of simple `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`
- With the help of the built in JavaScript API `Speech Synthesis`, it allows you to integrate text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities into your web applications easily and effectively.

# How to use 

- Simply type in the text you wish to be read back to you, select the voice you want to read back your text and press the listen button.
- The program is not live on a server. It runs locally on my VsCode with the `Live` extension. If you wish to see the application work, you can copy the repo files onto your local machine and run it with the same extension I used.
